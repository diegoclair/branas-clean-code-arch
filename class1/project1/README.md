# Description
We have a file `old-cpfcode.js` that has an code that should calculate if a CPF document is valid or not

### ‚ùó First of all:
* You need to have golang 1.15+ installed in your machine
## Goal of the class
We should refactor the code in the language that we want, trying to implement a better clean code and tests!
### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Start application üíª 
To run the code, inside of project1 folder, just run `go run new.go`  
### Tests
If you want to run all tests, just run the command `go test *.go`

### Observations
For the project was expected to implement CPF validation. At first moment, we only have CPF validation, but in the future, I want to implement CNPJ validation too.
